--This repo is used to store the LaTeX for a document about polynomial interpolation and Runge's phenomenon.
--The document discusses the topic of polynomial interpolation as well as some methods for interpolating such as 
monomial basis, Newton polynomials, Lagrange basis functions, and splines. 
--The document ends with a brief overview of Runge's phenomenon and how we can analyze it's errors usinig Taylor/Lagrange's
remainder theorem.
--Document is meant to serve as an introduction to a prominent topic in numerical computing.
